    "\n",
    "The **NOVA classification** is a framework for grouping foods based on the extent and purpose of food processing. Developed by researchers at the University of São Paulo, it classifies foods into four groups. Research has linked higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (Group 4) with various health concerns. The classification helps us understand not just what we eat, but how it's been processed. For more information, see the [NOVA classification Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_classification).\n",
